# Text Based Dungeon Crawler Project

##  Game Idea:

* The idea of the project is to create a game that the user can run through the terminal in VS Code.
* The game allows the player to go through different rooms in where there are different enemies randomly generated that the player needs to defeat.
* If the player wins the battle, experience to level up and a score will be added.
* Once the score reach 10 points, the player wins the game and can leave the dungeon.
